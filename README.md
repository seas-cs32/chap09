by Michael D. Smith.

`bf_strmatch*.py`: Two different Python implementations of a brute-force algorithm for string matching.

`test.txt`: A short text file on which we time the two implementations of brute-force string matching.

`cmp_bf_times.py`: A script that times our two brute-force implementations on the example input `JustDavid.txt`.

`JustDavid.txt`: A reasonably long input that allows us to compare our two brute-force implementations.

`rk_strmatch.py`: A Python implementation of Rabin-Karp string matching.

`cmp_strmatch.py`: A script to compare the running times of our brute-force and Rabin-Karp algorithms.  You might not want to wait until it finishes. The last runs for brute-force can take a long time.

`ale01.py`: Code in ALE 9.1.

`ale04c.py`, `ale04d.py`: Code for ALE 9.4 steps 3 and 4.

`Smith_fig_09_04_05.ipynb`: Source code for the graphs in Figures 9.4 and 9.5 (in _Computational Thinking and Problem Solving_ by Michael D. Smith. The graphs illustrate the results of the brute-force (BF) and Rabin-Karp (RK) string matching experiments described in Chapter 9. The test results are produced by `chap09/cmp_strmatch.py`.
