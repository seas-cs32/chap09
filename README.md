This directory contains everything needed for
**Chapter 9 (Find a Phrase)** in
*Computational Thinking and Problem Solving*.

`bf_strmatch*.py`: Two different Python implementations of a brute-force
algorithm for string matching.

`cmp_bf_times.py`: A script that times our two brute-force implementations on
the example input `JustDavid.txt`.

`JustDavid.txt`: A reasonably long input that allows us to compare our
two brute-force implementations.

`rk_strmatch.py`: A Python implementation of Rabin-Karp string matching.

`cmp_strmatch.py`: A script to compare the running times of our brute-force and
Rabin-Karp algorithms.  You might not want to wait until it finishes. The last
runs for brute-force can take a long time.

`ale01.py`: Code in ALE \#1.

`ale02.py`: Code in ALE \#2.
